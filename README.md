# Ahnenblatt v. 2.99e  

* Why is it called “Ahnenblatt”?
Ahnenblatt is a “Made in Germany” Windows-based genealogy software. But why is an international software called “Ahnenblatt”?

* Ahnenblatt is a German word and means “ancestor sheet”. A formular on a single sheet of paper for collecting all data of a single person. And indeed, the person’s input dialog in the very first version of Ahnenblatt (back in 1992 for the Atari ST – the great-grandfather of a modern PC) was a simple dialog for basic data which could easily fit on a single sheet.

* Nowadays Ahnenblatt’s input dialog is much more complexer for fitting on a single sheet, but is still easy to handle every detail of your ancestor’s lifes.
